# Bouncing Balls Game with Evil Circle

This project demonstrates an interactive **bouncing balls** animation where the user can control an "Evil Circle" to eliminate balls by moving it around the canvas. This project was created as part of a learning exercise in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features:
- **Bouncing Balls**: Balls of random colors and sizes bounce around the screen, colliding with each other and changing colors on impact.
- **Evil Circle**: The user controls a white "Evil Circle" using the **W**, **A**, **S**, and **D** keys. The circle can capture and remove bouncing balls, updating the ball count in real-time.
- **Real-time Ball Count**: A dynamic display of the remaining balls on the screen.

## How to Play:
- Use the **W**, **A**, **S**, and **D** keys to move the "Evil Circle" around the canvas.
- The goal is to capture as many bouncing balls as possible by colliding with them.
- The remaining ball count is displayed at the top of the screen.

## Project Structure:
- `index.html`: Contains the basic HTML structure.
- `style.css`: Provides the layout and style for the page, including background animations and text effects.
- `main.js`: The core JavaScript file that handles the game logic, including ball physics, collisions, and user interaction with the Evil Circle.
